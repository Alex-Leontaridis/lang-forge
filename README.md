## 📖 Usage Guide

### Variable Management (NEW!)

1. **Explicit Variable Declaration**
   - Switch to "Declaration" tab in Variable Manager
   - Define input variables with types (string, int, float, boolean, array, object)
   - Set validation rules (patterns, ranges, enums)
   - Mark required fields and set default values

2. **Auto-declaration from Prompt**
   - Write prompts using `{{variable}}` syntax
   - Click "Auto-declare variables from prompt"
   - System automatically creates input variable declarations

3. **Variable Validation**
   - Real-time validation against declared inputs
   - Type checking and constraint validation
   - Visual indicators for validation issues

4. **Chain Health Monitoring**
   - View health issues in the Chain Health panel
   - Identify undeclared variables, unused inputs, and dangling outputs
   - Get severity-based warnings and errors

5. **Variable Flow Tracking**
   - Visualize how variables flow between nodes
   - Hover to see detailed flow information
   - Filter by flow types (direct, transformed, conditional)

### Creating and Managing Versions

1. **Create a New Version**
   - Click "Create New Version" in the Version History panel
   - Enter a title and optional commit message
   - The new version will be created with current prompt and variables

2. **Version Comparison**
   - Select multiple versions using the checkboxes
   - View side-by-side comparison with scores and metrics
   - Analyze performance differences between versions

3. **Version Actions**
   - **Duplicate**: Create a copy of any version
   - **Delete**: Remove versions (prevents deletion of last version)
   - **Search**: Filter versions by title or message

### Using the Analytics Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Analytics Tab**
   - View comprehensive metrics across all versions
   - Analyze performance trends over time
   - Compare model performance

2. **Key Metrics**
   - **Total Versions**: Number of prompt versions created
   - **Total Runs**: Number of model executions
   - **Avg Response Time**: Average execution time across all runs
   - **Total Tokens**: Cumulative token usage for cost tracking

3. **Charts Available**
   - **PromptScore Over Time**: Track score improvements across versions
   - **Model Performance Comparison**: Compare different AI models
   - **Execution Time**: Monitor performance optimization
   - **Token Usage**: Track cost and efficiency
   - **Failure Rate**: Identify problematic prompts
   - **Version Score Comparison**: Overall performance comparison

### Working with Variables

1. **Adding Variables**
   - Use `{{variableName}}` syntax in your prompts
   - Add variables through the Variable Manager
   - Set default values for testing

2. **Dynamic Testing**
   - Change variable values to test different scenarios
   - Variables are automatically replaced in prompts
   - Each version maintains its own variable set

### Multi-Model Testing

1. **Select Models**
   - Choose from 20+ available models
   - Mix different providers (OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter)
   - Run multiple models simultaneously

2. **Compare Results**
   - View outputs from all selected models
   - Compare scores and performance metrics
   - Identify the best model for your use case

- Set reasonable validation rules (min/max values, enums)
- Use descriptive variable names and descriptions
- Regularly check chain health for issues

### Version Management
- Use descriptive version titles and commit messages
- Create versions frequently to track improvements
- Compare versions regularly to identify best performers
- Use the search feature for large version sets

### Analytics Usage
- Monitor failure rates to identify problematic prompts
- Track token usage for cost optimization

- Validate variable usage with the health monitoring system

## 🧪 Testing

Run the variable management tests to verify functionality:

```bash
npx tsx src/test-variable-management.ts
```

This comprehensive test suite validates:
- Input variable declaration and validation
- Output variable tracking
- Variable flow between nodes
