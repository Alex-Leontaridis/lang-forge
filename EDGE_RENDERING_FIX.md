# Edge Rendering Fix Summary

## Problem
When users navigate from canvas to editor and back to canvas, the lines (edges) between nodes were not showing properly. This was happening because:

1. Edges were being saved to localStorage but not properly restored with their styling
2. ReactFlow component wasn't re-rendering properly when navigating back
3. Edge styling information was being lost during the navigation process

## Root Cause
The issue was in the edge loading logic in `PromptChainCanvas.tsx`. When edges were loaded from localStorage, they weren't being properly restored with their styling and condition information. Additionally, the ReactFlow component wasn't getting a fresh render when navigating back to the canvas.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Edge Loading Logic
- **File**: `src/components/PromptChainCanvas.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~485-520
- **Change**: Modified the edge loading logic to properly restore edge styling based on condition state
- **Details**: 
  - Added logic to apply conditional styling for edges with enabled conditions
  - Added logic to apply default styling for regular edges
  - Ensured all edge properties (style, labelStyle, label) are properly restored

### 2. Added Loading State Management
- **File**: `src/components/PromptChainCanvas.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~260, ~520
- **Change**: Added `isLoaded` state to track when the component has fully loaded
- **Details**: 
  - Added `isLoaded` state variable
  - Set `isLoaded` to true after initial data is processed
  - Used this state to control when edge re-rendering should occur

### 3. Force Re-render Mechanism
- **File**: `src/components/PromptChainCanvas.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~770-810
- **Change**: Added useEffect to force ReactFlow to re-render edges when component mounts
- **Details**:
  - Added timer-based re-render mechanism
  - Ensures edges are properly styled after component loads
  - Runs when `isLoaded` state changes or edges length changes

### 4. Canvas Key Management
- **File**: `src/components/PromptChainCanvas.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~260, ~520, ~1730
- **Change**: Added `canvasKey` state to force fresh ReactFlow renders
- **Details**:
  - Added `canvasKey` state variable
  - Increment key when component loads to force fresh render
  - Updated ReactFlow component key to include `canvasKey`

### 5. Enhanced ReactFlow Configuration
- **File**: `src/components/PromptChainCanvas.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~1730
- **Change**: Added `fitView` and `fitViewOptions` props to ReactFlow
- **Details**:
  - Added `fitView` prop to ensure proper view fitting
  - Added `fitViewOptions` with padding for better visualization
  - Updated component key to include multiple factors for proper re-rendering

### 6. Additional Edge Visibility Enhancement
- **File**: `src/components/PromptChainCanvas.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~810-840
- **Change**: Added additional useEffect to ensure edges are visible after ReactFlow initialization
- **Details**:
  - Added temporary property injection to force re-render
  - Removes temporary property after short delay
  - Ensures ReactFlow properly displays edges after full initialization

## Testing
Created a test file `test-edge-rendering.html` to verify:
1. Edge loading from localStorage works correctly
2. Default styling is applied properly
3. Conditional styling is applied correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. When users connect nodes in canvas, edges should be visible immediately
2. When users navigate to editor and back to canvas, edges should remain visible
3. Conditional edges should maintain their special styling (blue, dashed lines)
4. Regular edges should maintain their default styling (gray, solid lines)
5. Edge labels should be properly displayed for conditional edges
